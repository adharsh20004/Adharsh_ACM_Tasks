For this task, I used YOLOv8s and did transfer learning with a dataset from roboflow which has a collection of images of different types of racecars.

I have also used wandb to get all the metrics and evaluations.

The link the dataset : https://universe.roboflow.com/tyrone-brock/racecars-v5/dataset/18

I couldn't upload the output folder here as it was too big. Hence I have uploaded it on google drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bP8jnmbyNUfSHy307W1t_tE7mM_94kU7/view?usp=sharing
