This repo consists of my submission for ACM Student Chapter AI SIG tasks. 

1. The first task is a basic image classification using a DNN. I used a butterfly classification dataset from Kaggle and ResNet 50 to approach this task.

2. The second task is a chatbot which I made using streamlit and Gemini Pro.

3. The third task required me to do transfer learning. I used YOLOV8s and trained it over a dataset which consists of several images of 5 types of racecars. And now the model can detect those 5 types of racecars from an image.   

Thank you
