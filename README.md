This repo consists of my submission for ACM Student Chapter AI SIG tasks. 
•	The first task is a basic image classification using a DNN. I used a butterfly classification dataset from Kaggle and ResNet 50 to approach this task. 
•	The second task is a chatbot made using streamlit and Gemini Pro. Using streamlit's easy to understand documentation, I have built a chatbot. 
•	The third task required me to do transfer learning. I used YOLOV8s and trained it over a dataset which consists of several images of 5 types of racecars. 
      o	And now the model can detect those 5 types of racecars from an image.

Thank you
